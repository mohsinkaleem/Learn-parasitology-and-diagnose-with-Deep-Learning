Apicomplexa,	Conoidasida,Cryptosporidium,Cryptosporidium sp.,Oocysts,Fecal,Crypto_wtmt_annot.jpg,Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts (pink arrows) in wet mount. A budding yeast (brown arrow) is in the same field.,https://www.cdc.gov//dpdx/cryptosporidiosis/images/1/Crypto_wtmt_annot.jpg
Apicomplexa,	Conoidasida,Cryptosporidium,Cryptosporidium sp.,Oocysts,Fecal,DPDxCrypto_oo_DIC.jpg,"Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in wet mount, under differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. The oocysts are rounded and measure 4.2 µm - 5.4 µm in diameter. Sporozoites are visible inside the oocysts, indicating that sporulation has occurred.",https://www.cdc.gov//dpdx/cryptosporidiosis/images/1/DPDxCrypto_oo_DIC.jpg
